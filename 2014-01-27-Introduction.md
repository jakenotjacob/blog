Hey there!  And welcome to my blog.

Here I will be making posts on subjects related to the world of computing: 
networking, system administration, and programming being the primary focuses. 
These posts will vary from lengthy dissections and discussions of things I am 
learning, to small snippets of code and tutorials that I find useful.

Most recently, my focus has been in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and Puppet; 
a programming language, web-developement framework, and automated server 
management and deploying tool (also written in Ruby).

I hope that by beginning to make these posts, I can build up a reference 
that you may find resourceful, and one that I can use so that less sticky-notes
are cluttered on my desk. ;)

Enjoy!
